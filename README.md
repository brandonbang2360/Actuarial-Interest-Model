Reusable actuarial interest factors used across valuation calculations.
### Annuities
Present and future value calculations for annuity immediate and annuity due payment streams.
### Loans
Dynamic loan amortization schedule decomposing payments into interest and principal.
### Sensitivity Analysis
Interest rate scenario testing using Excel data tables.
### Dashboard
Executive summary visualizing key financial outcomes.
